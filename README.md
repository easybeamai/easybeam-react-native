## Overview

The Easybeam SDK for React Native provides a seamless integration with the Easybeam AI platform, allowing developers to easily incorporate AI-powered chat functionality into their React Native applications. This SDK supports both streaming and non-streaming interactions with Easybeam's portals and workflows.

## Features

- Stream responses from Easybeam portals and workflows
- Make non-streaming requests to portals and workflows
- Handle user reviews for chat interactions
- TypeScript support for improved developer experience
- Built-in error handling and event management

## Installation

```bash
npm install easybeam-react-native-sdk
```

## Usage

### Initializing the SDK

```typescript
import { Easybeam, EasyBeamConfig } from "easybeam-react-native-sdk";

const config: EasyBeamConfig = {
  token: "your-api-token-here",
};

const easybeam = new Easybeam(config);
```

### Streaming a Portal Response

```typescript
const portalId = "your-portal-id";
const userId = "user-123";
const filledVariables = { key: "value" };
const messages = [
  {
    content: "Hello",
    role: "USER",
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    id: "1",
  },
];

easybeam.streamPortal(
  portalId,
  userId,
  filledVariables,
  messages,
  (response) => {
    console.log("New message:", response.newMessage);
  },
  () => {
    console.log("Stream closed");
  },
  (error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
);
```

### Making a Non-Streaming Portal Request

```typescript
const response = await easybeam.getPortal(
  portalId,
  userId,
  filledVariables,
  messages
);
console.log("Portal response:", response);
```

### Submitting a Review

```typescript
await easybeam.review("chat-123", "user-123", 5, "Great experience!");
```
